# Single_number_timer

This project uses PlatformIO as it's ecosystem.
This project lights up segments of the display to show a number. It begins counting from 0 to 9 then displays the decimal point then counts from 9 to 0 and begins counting in ascending again. Repeats this cycle until there is no power in circuit.

## Pins and corresponding segments
A = 3 
B = 2
C = 7
D = 8
E = 9
F = 4
G = 5
DP(decimal point) = 6

## Tools used

An Arduino compatible board
Breadboard (2)
1k ohms resistors(8)
7 segment display
Jumper wires(9)
